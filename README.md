# Coffee Timer
Display the age of coffee using an Arduino and 16x2 LCD.

The purpose of this project is to have an automated tool 
that reports the age of the coffee in the office coffee pot.
It senses the coffee brewing being activated by detecting a 
strong current draw on the coffee brewer's cord.  An Arduino
and 16x2 LCD displays the age of the coffee once the brewing
is complete.
